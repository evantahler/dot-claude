# Preferences

## Output Formatting

- Prefer **bulleted lists** and **ASCII tables** over prose whenever presenting structured information
- Use terminal colors (ANSI escape codes) when appropriate to improve readability — e.g., green for success, red for errors, yellow for warnings, bold for emphasis
- Keep responses concise and scannable
